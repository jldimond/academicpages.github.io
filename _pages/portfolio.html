## Lab notebook

In the future this site may house my lab notebook, but for now my notebook is located at [Open Notebook Science Network](http://onsnetwork.org/jdimond/). This is where I try to keep records on any "wet" bench work or field work.

## Github

Most of my projects these days result in data analysis workflows using R and/or jupyter notebook. Repositories detailing such work are kept in [my Github account](https://github.com/jldimond/). A recent example: <https://github.com/jldimond/Branching-Porites>
