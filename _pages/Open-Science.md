In keeping with open and reproducible science practices, I maintain openly accessible records of the research I conduct.

## Lab Notebook

In the future this site may house my lab notebook, but for now my notebook is located at [Open Notebook Science Network](http://onsnetwork.org/jdimond/). This is where I try to keep records on any “wet” bench work or field work.

## Github Repositories

Most of my projects these days result in computing workflows using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and/or [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Repositories detailing such work are kept in my [Github account](https://github.com/jldimond/). A recent [example](https://github.com/jldimond/Branching-Porites)
