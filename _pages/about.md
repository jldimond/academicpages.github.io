I'm a marine biologist with a background primarily in the biology and ecology of symbiotic cnidarians, including organisms such as sea anemones and corals that live in shallow, sunlit waters and rely to varying degrees on nutritional contributions from symbiotic algae residing within their own cells. I recently completed a PhD in the [Roberts Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) at the University of Washington's [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/), where I studied epigenetics in reef corals, specifically the role of a process known as [DNA methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation). Please see the [Research](https://jldimond.github.io/pubs/) page for more information on my research.

I work at Western Washington University's [Shannon Point Marine Center](http://www.wwu.edu/spmc/). Here, my role includes boating and diving support for courses and research, coastal oceanographic monitoring for the [Washington Department of Ecology](https://ecology.wa.gov/Research-Data/Monitoring-assessment/Puget-Sound-and-marine-monitoring), teaching, and advising student research projects.
