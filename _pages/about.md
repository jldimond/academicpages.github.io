I'm a marine biologist currently completing a PhD focusing in the [Roberts Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) at the [University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/). My background is primarily in the biology and ecology of symbiotic cnidarians, organisms such as sea anemones and corals that live in shallow waters and rely on nutritional contributions from  algal symbionts. In the Roberts Lab, my PhD work examines the role of the epigenetic process known as DNA methylation in coral phenotypic plasticity and response to environmental change. Please see my Publications page for more information on my research.

I also work as a Marine Technologist at Western Washington University's [Shannon Point Marine Center](http://www.wwu.edu/spmc/). Here, my work encompasses boating and diving support, coastal oceanographic data collection, and student mentoring, among other duties.
