I'm a marine biologist who uses genomic approaches to address questions in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation. Much of my research has centered on cnidarians that host unicellular protists (primarily dinoflagellates) within their own cells. These symbioses are widespread in shallow tropical and temperate seas, being most notable among reef corals that form the trophic and structural foundation of coral reef ecosystems. My current interests and directions include (1) the molecular processes governing cnidarian-algal symbioses, (2) the molecular basis of phenotypic variation and acclimatization in symbiotic cnidarians and other marine organisms, (3) the conservation genetics of marine organisms, and (4) the use of environmental DNA to detect and monitor rare species. Please see the [Research](https://jldimond.github.io/pubs/) page for more information on my research.

I am stationed at Western Washington University's [Shannon Point Marine Center](http://www.wwu.edu/spmc/) in beautiful Anacortes, Washington. I serve as a Research Assistant Professor and Capstone Coordinator for Western's [Marine and Coastal Sciences Program](https://marine.wwu.edu/). Meanwhile, I also work as a postdoc with [Puget Sound Restoration Fund](https://restorationfund.org/), focusing on the conservation genetics of pinto abalone (_Haliotis kamtschatkana_) and basket cockles (_Clinocardium nuttallii_).
