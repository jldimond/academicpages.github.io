I'm a marine biologist currently completing a PhD in the [Roberts Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) at the University of Washington's [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/). My background is primarily in the biology and ecology of symbiotic cnidarians, inlcuding organisms such as sea anemones and corals that live in shallow, sunlit waters and rely to varying degrees on nutritional contributions from algal symbionts. Currently, my PhD work examines the role of an epigenetic process known as [DNA methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation) in coral phenotypic plasticity and response to environmental change. Please see the [Publications](https://jldimond.github.io/pubs/) page for more information on my research.

I also work as a Marine Technologist at Western Washington University's [Shannon Point Marine Center](http://www.wwu.edu/spmc/). Here, my role includes boating and diving support for courses and research, coastal oceanographic monitoring for the [Washington Department of Ecology](https://ecology.wa.gov/Research-Data/Monitoring-assessment/Puget-Sound-and-marine-monitoring), and advising student research projects, among other duties.
